A fully AI generated fictional online shop for all things witchcraft, brought to you by ChatGPT, Midjourney, and an amateur programmer.

This website was built for a university project and exists merely for research purposes. 
It is an attempt to create an online shop, completely without prior programming knowledge on my end, using only AI for assistance. The shop is not functional but is supposed to give the impression of being a real shop, only without a payment function. Product images, descriptions, and design decisions are all generated by AI. The quality of the website and its individual elements can be evaluated by users through a survey that's linked on the site. 
The project is an experimental exploration of how good or comprehensive a final product can be if it is created with minimal human intervention. The challenge for AI lies in visually and convincingly merging fiction and reality, which becomes especially interesting given the fantastical nature of the website theme. User impressions gathered through the survey will be summarized in a seperate document and handed in as part of the project.
